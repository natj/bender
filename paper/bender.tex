\begin{abstract}
Formulas and a robust framework are derived for emission from and around compact rotating objects.
We focus on the emission from rotating neutron stars and describe the surrounding spacetime metric that is second-order in rotation.
Similarly, we take the second order effect of the oblate shape of the star into account.
Whole framework is derived in a fully general relativistic way, hence acting also as a validation tool for previous ad-hoc special relativistic formulations.
As an application - and a validation -  we then use the machinery to calculate accurate pulse profiles from hot spots around fastly rotating neutron stars.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Accurately modelling the emission from and around a compact objects is a complicated combination of radiative processes and relativity.
Not only is the object bending the spacetime around it, and hence affecting the trajectory of photons, but also affecting the apparent observed radiation by its fast rotation and relativistic surface velocities.
Applications for such accurate analysis of the radiation range from numerous black hole disk emission studies to neutron star (NS) pulse profile analysis.
Emission around rotating (Kerr) black holes has been very nicely formulated by the publicly available \textsc{geokerr} code.
On the other hand, a further complication with neutron stars is that the emission is not only originating from the viscinity of the object but from the surface of the star itself.
Hence, computing accurate pulse profiles from e.g. hot spots rotating around fastly spinning neutron stars has been under a lot of scrutinity recently, because of many upcoming or planned new spaceborne observatories like ESA's \textit{XIPE} or NASA's \textit{NICER} X-ray missions.
With accurate pulse profile observations there is a lot of hope for constraining, for example, the still unknown equation of state of neutron stars from the information encoded to the radiation from the surrounding spacetime of the object.

The spacetime metrics around a static non-rotating spherically symmetric object is given by the well known \sch solution
\begin{align}\begin{split}
ds^2 & = -(1-u)dt^2 + \\
     & (1-u)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)
\end{split}\end{align}
where $u = 2GM/c^2 r$ is the dimensionless compact factor and $r$ is the radial coordinate that is defined so that an area of a sphere in this coordinate system is the usual $4\pi r^2$ at some fixed time.
This is equivalent to an alternative solution known as isotropic \sch metric \citep[see for e.g.][]{MTW73}
\begin{align}\begin{split}
\label{eq:ISch}
ds^2 & = -\left( \frac{1-\frac{\ub}{2}}{1+\frac{\ub}{2}} \right)^2 dt^2 + \\
     & (1+\frac{\ub}{2})^4(d\rb^2 + \rb^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)),
\end{split}\end{align}
where $\ub=GM/c^2\rb$ and $\rb$ are the isotropic radial coordinate and the corresponding isotropic compact factor. 
%defined so that the circumference of a circle in this metric is $2\pi\rb$.
This kind of isotropic metric has a useful feature that surfaces of constant time are conformally flat, and hence the angles are represented without distortion.
%In this kind of isotropic metric the angles in the constant time hyperslices are represented without distortion, hence the name of the metric.
It, however, also means that angular isotropic coordinates do not faithfully represent the distances within the spheres nor does the radial coordinate correspond directly to the radial distances.
Note that from here on, we mark all variables related to the isotropic radial coordinate with a bar on top.
%The relation between these two radial coordinates can be easily seen to be $r = \rb(1+\ub)^2$.

Let us now consider a rotating compact object.
In addition to the dimensionless compact factor $u(r)$ (or $\ub(\rb)$) we now need a dimensionless angular velocity to describe our system
\be
\Ob = \Omega \left( \frac{\Req^3}{G M} \right)^{1/2},
\ee
where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of a sphere with an equatorial radius $\Req$ and a mass $M$ scaled with a Newtonian mass shedding (Kepler) limit $(GM/\Req^3)^{1/2}$ \citep[see][p.29]{rcs}.
Here $\Req$ is described using the usual \sch radial coordinate and corresponds to the equatorial radius of the star for which $2\pi\Req$ gives the proper length of the circumference.
The metrics near a stationary axisymmetric rotating object that is asymptotically flat can be written similarly to equation \eqref{eq:ISch} in isotropic form as \citep{BW71} 
%\bea
\begin{align}\begin{split} \label{eq:BWmetric}
ds^2 & = -e^{2\nub}c^2dt^2 +
     \rb^2 \sin^2\theta \Bb^2 e^{-2\nub}(d\phi - \wb cdt)^2 + \\
     & e^{2(\zetab-\nub)}(d\rb^2 + \rb^2d\theta^2),
\end{split}\end{align}
%\eea
where $\wb$ is the angular velocity of the local inertial frame and the functions $\nub$, $\Bb$ and $\zetab$ in the metric coefficients can be expanded in the powers of $\Ob$ and $\ub$ \citep{BI76}.
%\red{rcs:14}
%\red{rcs:15}
Here $e^{-\nub}$ is the time dilatation factor relating the proper time of the local observer to the time at infinity.
Physical interpretation of $\Bb$ follows from the fact that the proper circumference of a circle around the axis of symmetry is $2\pi(e^{-\nub} \Bb \rb \sin\theta)$.
Similarly, the interpretation of $\zetab$ follows from the fact that $e^{\zetab - \nub}$ acts as a conformal (angle preserving) factor of the spacetime. %determining the orthogonality of the 2-surfaces.
The zeroth terms of the series expansions ($\Ob = 0$) are the familiar isotropic \sch metric coefficients (see Table \ref{tab:coeffs}).
%\be
%e^{\nu_0} = (1-\ub/2)/(1+\ub/2),
%\ee
%\be 
%\Bb_0 = (1-\ub/2)(1+\ub/2)
%\ee
%and
%\be
%\zetab_0 = \log \Bb_0.
%\ee

The first order expansion in rotation ($\Ob^1$) is formally related to Kerr metric.
In this case we introduce an angular velocity term of the local inertial frame $\wb$ that accounts for the frame-dragging effects. %\red{rcs:13}
Up to first order, this can be defined as
\be
\wb = \frac{2c^4j}{G^2M}\ub^3,
\ee
where the dimensionless quantity $j=\mathcal{J}/M^2$ and $\mathcal{J} = I \Omega$ is the star's angular momentum with moment of inertia $I(M,\Omega)$.

Finally, the second order expansion ($\Ob^2$) correspond to a similar approximation as the Hartle-Throne slow-rotation spacetime that introduces quadrupole moments into the metric.
These second order multipolemoments can be defined via dimensionless quantities $q$ and $\beta$ that are the dimensionless moments of energy density and pressure.
\citet{aGM14} defined an approximative relation for these parameters based on their computations of rotating NSs with various different EoSs.
Due to the NS spacetime being almost hairless we can parameterize these quantities with great accuracy by only using the dimensionless angular velocity $\Ob$ and compactness factor
\be
x = \frac{G M}{c^2 \Req}.
\ee
Note that both of these parameters are defined via the equatorial circumferential radius \Req defined in the usual \sch radial coordinate system.
To the lowest order, these approximations are
\be
q = -0.11 \frac{\Ob^2}{x^2},
\ee
\be
\beta = 0.4454 \Ob^2 x,
\ee
and
\be
I = \sqrt{x} (1.136 - 2.53 x + 5.6 x^2) M \Req^2.
\ee
Note also that both $q$ and $\beta$ are $\mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$, while $I$ is $\mathcal{O}(\Ob)$.
    
It is possible to transfer between the usual $r$ and the isotropic $\rb$ coordinates by using the relation \citep{FIP86}
\be\label{eq:rb2r}
r = \Bb e^{-\nub} \rb.
\ee
The relation between the two infinitesimal radial coordinates turns out to be
\be\label{eq:drb2dr}
dr = e^{\zetab} d\rb
\ee
that is calculated using the series presentation of \cite{BI76}.

Because the series expansions of the metric coefficients are expanded using the isotropic radial coordinate $\rb$ we will favor this notation in our derivation.
However, at some cases we will simplify the equations into more intuitive form by using the areal $r$ coordinate, and so, some caution is needed when dealing with the radial coordinates.

%The metrics of the rotating isoradial spacetime is then
%\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:isorad}
%ds^2 & = -e^{2\nub}c^2dt^2 +
%     r^2 \sin^2\theta (d\phi - \bar{\omega}cdt)^2 + \\
%     & e^{-2\nub}dr^2 + e^{2\mu}r^2d\theta^2),
%\end{split}\end{align}
%where $e^{2\mu} = e^{2\zetab}/\Bb^2$.

\subsection{Oblate shape of the neutron star}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figs/fig1.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:geom}
  Geometry of the system.
}
\end{figure}


Due to the rotation and finite pressure supporting the system the neutron star is no longer a sphere when it is rotating.
It, however, retains the axialsymmetry and can be approximated with an oblate spheroid.
Similarly to the second order space-time quantities, \citet{aGM14} derived an approximate shape of the star as
\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:radf}
    R(\theta) &= \Req \left( 1 - \frac{\Req - R_{\mathrm{p}}}{\Req} \cos^2\theta \right) \\
              &= \Req (1-\Ob^2 (0.788 - 1.03x) \cos^2 \theta,
\end{split}\end{align}
where $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the radius on the rotational axis and $R(\pi/2) = \Req$ is the equatorial circumferential radius measured in the usual \sch metric. 
Elemental surface area for a spheroid is given as (using the areal radial coordinates)
\be
dS(\theta) = R^2(\theta) \sin\theta \sqrt{1 + f(\theta)^2}d\theta d\phi,
\ee
where
\be
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{\bar{R}(\theta)} \frac{d \bar{R}(\theta)}{d \theta} = \Bb e^{-\zetab-\nub} \frac{1}{R(\theta)} \frac{dR(\theta)}{d\theta}, 
\ee
and $\Bb e^{-\zetab-\nub} \approx (1-\frac{2 G M}{c^2 r})^{-1/2} + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$.
The angle $\gamma$, defined as the angle between the radial unit vector $\vec{r}$ and the surface normal $\vec{n}$, is given by
\be
\cos\gamma = (1 - f(\theta)^2)^{-1/2}.
\ee
Then the normal to the surface can be defined using the radial vector $\vec{r}$ and the tangential vector $\vec{\theta}$ as
\be
\vec{n} = \cos\gamma \vec{r} + \sin\gamma \vec{\theta}.
\ee
See also Fig.~\ref{fig:geom} for a clarification of the angles.
From here it is again clear how the angles transform easily in the isotropic metric while the quantities related to the area are simplified in the usual \sch metric.

\subsection{Geodesic motion through Hamilton-Jacobi equation}
Geodesic motion in space-time characterized by a metric function $g^{ij}$ is governed by Hamilton-Jacobi equation
\be
2\frac{\pd S}{\pd \tau} = g^{ij} \frac{\pd S}{\pd x^i}\frac{\pd S}{\pd x^j},
\ee
where S denotes the Hamilton's principal function.
For the two Killing vectors $k_{t}^{\alpha} = (1,0,0,0)$ (asymptotic time symmetry) and $k_{\phi}^{\alpha} = (0,0,0,1)$ (rotation symmetry along azimuthal angles) in the rotating space-time, the Frobenius theorem implies the existence of a family of 2-surfaces orthogonal to these vectors \citep[see e.g][p.12]{rcs}.
This means that there are surfaces of constant $t$ and $\phi$ in our spacetime i.e. constants of motion.
These constants we name to be $E$ and $L_z$, respectively.
We then seek a solution in the form
\be
S = \frac{1}{2}\delta_1 \tau - Et + L_z\phi + S_{\rb}(\rb) + S_{\theta}(\theta).
\ee
With the metric function \eqref{eq:BWmetric} this becomes
%\begin{align}\begin{split}
%2 r^2 \delta_{1} =~ & e^{2\nub} r^2 \pd_r^2 - e^{-2\nub} r^2 (E-L_z \omega)^2 \\
%& + e^{-2\mu} \pd_\theta^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 \theta},
%\end{split}\end{align}
\begin{align}\begin{split} 
    \delta_1 \rb^2 \Bb^2 e^{-2\nub} =~& \rb^2 \Bb^2 e^{-2\zetab} \pd_{\rb}S_{\rb}S^2 - e^{-4\nub} \Bb^2 \rb^2 (E - L_z \wb)^2 \\
                                & + \Bb^2 e^{-2\zetab} \pd_{\theta}S_{\theta}^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta}.
\end{split}\end{align}
After re-organizing the terms and using a simplifying notation $e^{\zetab}/\Bb \equiv e^{\mub}$ we find
\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:S}
& e^{-2\mub}\pd_{\theta}S_{\theta}^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta} = \\ 
& \Bb^2 e^{-2\nub}\rb^2 ( e^{2(\nub-\zetab)} \pd_{\rb}S_{\rb}^2 -\delta_{1} - e^{-2\nub}(E - L_z \wb)^2,
\end{split}\end{align}
%By using the isoradial coordinate $r$ and notation $e^{\zetab}/\Bb \equiv e^{\mu}$ this can be simplified to
%\begin{align}\begin{split}
%    \delta_1 r^2 &- e^{2\nub} r^2 \pd_rS^2 \\
%                &+ e^{-2\nub} r^2 (E+L_z \wb)^2 = e^{-\mu} \pd_{\theta}S^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta},
%\end{split}\end{align}
that already hints towards separability only if $\nub = \nub(\rb)$, $\Bb = \Bb(\rb)$, $\zetab = \zetab(\rb)$ and $\mu = \mu(\theta)$.
For the first order in rotation (i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\Ob)$) this condition is satisfied exactly because $e^{\mub} = 1 + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$, in addition to $\Bb = \Bb_0(\rb) + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$ and $\Bb = \Bb_0(\rb) + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$ (see Table \ref{tab:coeffs}). 
In the second order of the expansion, $\theta$ dependent mass and pressure quadrupole moments are presented, and so our separation is no more valid.
For the geodesics, however, these higher order deviations only contribute very close to the actual NS surface, and hence enable us to obtain accurate (but still approximate) photon paths by neglecting them.
%\red{rcs:66}
%However, the deviations are rather small and for $\mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$ pressure(?) quadrupole moment is negliblible after which we are left with  mass quadropole moment only.
%In this case the dependence of $r$ and $\theta$ are present through $e^{\nub}$ terms but $e^{\mu} \approx 1$ still.
Notice also that because we only consider null geodesics i.e. light propagation we could happily set $\delta_1 = 0$ but we choose to keep it around a bit longer to favor generality.

If we now assume separability, we can introduce a separation variable $\Ca$ known as Carter's constant (third constant of motion) in order to solve the differential equation \eqref{eq:S}.
By noting that the conjugate momenta correspond to the first derivative of $S$, with respect to the generalized coordinates we can write the general four-momentum \fvec{p} components to be
\begin{align}
  p_t        &= -E \label{eq:p_t}\\
  p_{\rb}    &= \pm e^{\zetab - 2\nub} \left( \delta_1 e^{2\nub} + (E - L_z \wb)^2 - \frac{\Ca}{\Bb^2 e^{-4\nub} \rb^2} \right)^{1/2}\label{eq:p_r}\\
  p_{\theta} &= \pm e^{\mub} \left( \Ca - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta} \right)^{1/2}\label{eq:p_the}\\
  p_{\phi}   &= L_z\label{eq:p_p}.
\end{align}
From \fvec{p} it is also possible to derive the tetrad components 
\begin{align}
  p^{(t)} &= -p_{(t)} = -e_{(t)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = -e^{-\nub}p_t \label{eq:tetp_t}\\
  p^{(\rb)} &= p_{(\rb)} = e_{(\rb)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = e^{-\zetab + \nub} p_{\rb} \label{eq:tetp_r}\\
  p^{(\theta)} &= p_{(\theta)} = e_{(\theta)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = \frac{1}{\rb} e^{-\zetab+\nub} p_{\theta} \label{eq:tetp_theta}\\
  %p^{(\phi)} &= p_{(\phi)} = e_{(\phi)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = -e^{-\nub} \wb p_t + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} p_{\phi} \label{eq:tetp_phi},
  p^{(\phi)} &= p_{(\phi)} = e_{(\phi)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = \frac{1}{e^{-\nub} \Bb \rb \sin\theta} p_{\phi} \label{eq:tetp_phi},
\end{align}
where $e^{\hat{\mu}}_{(a)}$ with index $a = t, \rb, \theta$ and $\phi$ are the tetrads of our metric \eqref{eq:BWmetric}.


\subsection{Ray tracing photons}
Radiation is emitted from the surface of a star at an emission point $(r_e,\theta_e,\phi_e)$. 
The radiation travels along a geodesic with a spectral radiance $I_{\nu}$ as measured by an observer co-moving with the emission point.
The radiation is observed at an image plane situated at a radial distance $r$, with $r\rightarrow\infty$.
We then wish to calculate the projected image of the star at this image plane.

First we set up the coordinate system so that the plane of observation is towards $\phi = 0$ and $\theta = i$, where $i$ is the angle of inclination.
The geodesic will be emitted with a four-momentum $\fvec{p}_e$, and if it is eventually observed at the image plane at infinity, it will have a final four-momentum of $(E,\hat{p_r},0,0)$, purely in the radial direction.
Likewise, the components of the position must satisfy
\begin{align}
\theta &\rightarrow i \\
\phi   &\rightarrow 0,
\end{align}
as $r\rightarrow\infty$.
The change in the time and angular components along the geodesic can be written as
\begin{align}
dt      &= \frac{p^t}{p^{\rb}}\ud \rb \label{eq:deltatime} \\
d\theta &= \frac{p^\theta}{p^{\rb}}\ud \rb \label{eq:deltatheta} \\
d\phi   &= \frac{p^\phi}{p^{\rb}}\ud \rb \label{eq:deltaphi},
%d\theta &= \int_{r_e}^\infty \frac{p^\theta}{p^r}\ud r \label{eq:deltatheta} \\
%d\phi   &= \int_{r_e}^\infty \frac{p^\phi}{p^r}\ud r \label{eq:deltaphi},
\end{align}
with a total change of angles $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$ when integrating from $r_e$ to $\infty$.
The condition for being observed is then
\begin{align}
\theta_e + \Delta\theta &= i \label{eq:thetacond}\\
\phi_e + \Delta\phi     &= 0 \label{eq:phicond}.
\end{align}

The projected image of the star on the image plane can then be described by two celestial coordinates:
abscissa $\hat{x}$ and ordinate $\hat{y}$.
Making use of the tetrad components (\ref{eq:tetp_t} - \ref{eq:tetp_phi}) we obtain \citep[][p.347]{cha}
\be\label{eq:xhat}
\hat{x} = \left( \frac{rp^{(\phi)}}{p^{(t)}} \right)_{r \rightarrow \infty} = \frac{1}{\sin i} \frac{L_z}{E}
\ee
and
\be\label{eq:yhat}
\hat{y} = \left( \frac{rp^{(\theta)}}{p^{(t)}} \right)_{r \rightarrow \infty} = \frac{\sqrt{\Ca - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 i}}}{E}.
\ee
From here it is intriguing to chance into polar coordinate system as the form of the equations \eqref{eq:xhat} and \eqref{eq:yhat} strongly suggest a more intuitive form if done so.
In this new coordinate system we can define the radial distance from the center point, or the impact parameter $b$, and a rotation angle $\chi$.
We will take $\chi$ to increase clockwise from the projected spin axis of the neutron star, with $\chi=0$ corresponding to the projected direction from the south to the north pole of the neutron star.
We can then express the impact parameter $b$ and the angle $\chi$ via the constants of motion of the geodesics, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, and the Carter constant $\Ca$, at the image plane as%
\footnote{From here, the nature of Carter's constant as a ``general´´ angular momentum (squared) felt by the photon becomes clear when considering the usual definition $\vec{I} = \vec{b} \times \vec{p}$, where $\vec{I}$ is the angular momentum, $\vec{b}$ is the axis of the rotation, and $\vec{p}$ is the (linear) momentum.} 
\be
b = \frac{\sqrt{\Ca}}{E}
\ee
and
\be
\sin \chi = \frac{1}{\sin i} \frac{L_z}{\sqrt{\Ca}}
\ee
The constants of motion, combined with the geodesic null condition $p^\mu p_\mu = 0$, then allow us to solve $p^\theta$ and $p^\phi$ in terms of $\rb$.
%We can then substitute these back into equations \eqref{eq:thetacond} and \eqref{eq:phicond}, to get the implicit solutions for $b$ and $\chi$ as
%\begin{align}
%\theta_e + \Delta\theta &= \Theta(R_e, \theta_e, \phi_e, b, \chi) = i\\
%\phi_e + \Delta\phi     &= \Phi(R_e, \theta_e, \phi_e, b, \chi) = 0.
%\end{align}
Now as a final step we can substitute the four-momentum components and image-plane coordinates into \eqref{eq:deltatime} - \eqref{eq:deltaphi} and solve the system of three first-order differential equations (in terms of $t$, $\theta$ and $\phi$) with $\rb$ as a variable.
%% \begin{align}\begin{split}
%% %\int_{\mathrm{R_e}}^{\infty} \frac{p^{\phi}}{p^r} dr =

%However, with oblate stars it suffices to notice that the previous equations are further complicated by the fact that $\bar{R}_e = \bar{R}_e(\theta)$ and $\wb = \wb(\rb, \theta)$.


\subsection{Redshift and emission angle}
All of the radiative processes have to be defined in the co-rotating frame of the star.
To distinct such a quantities from a non-rotating ones, we denote each variable measured in an inertial frame that is momentarily comoving with the stellar surface with a prime.
On the other hand, our observer is stationary and moving along the timelike Killing vector.
Hence, we need to transform between stationary and rotating frames by using the 4-velocity of the star's fluid.
In addition, we need to take into account that a particle dropped from the infinity with a zero angular momentum acquire nonzero angular velocity in direction of the star's rotation due to dragging of inertial frames.
Four-velocity of a stationary observer is then $s^{\alpha} = s^t(t^{\alpha})$ where the normalization factor $s^t = e^{-\nub}(1-\vw^2)^{-1/2}$ is obtained from $s_{\alpha}s^{\alpha} = -1$ and the velocity of the frame is 
\be
\vw = \wb \Bb e^{-2\nub} \rb \sin\theta,
\ee
indicating that the angular velocity as measured by an inertial observer at infinity is $s^{\phi} / s^{t} = d\phi/dt = \wb$.

A circular flow can be defined using the timelike and rotational Killing vectors as $s'^{\alpha} = s'^t (t^{\alpha} + \Omega \phi^{\alpha})$, where the normalization factor is defined as $s'^t = e^{-\nub} (1 - \vz^2)^{-1/2}$ determined by $s'_{\alpha}s'^{\alpha} = -1$.
Here the velocity 
\be
\vz = (\Omega - \wb) \Bb e^{-2\nub} \rb \sin\theta,
\ee
can be identified to be the 3-velocity measured in the frame of a zero angular momentum observer, an observer rotating along the frame with a velocity of $\vw$.

%Observed redshift can then be obtained by comparing the energies of the emerging ($E' = u_{\alpha} s^{\alpha}$) and the observed photon ($E = u_{\alpha} o^{\alpha}$).
%Gravitational redshift from the non-rotating frame is given by $1+z_G = -o_{\alpha} u^{\alpha} = e^{\-nub}$ 
The total redshift as measured by an observed at infinity is then given by an inner-product between a photon $u^{\alpha}$ and a 4-velocity of the star's fluid $s'^{\alpha}$.
With these definitions the redshift is
\be
1 + z = -s'_{\alpha} u^{\alpha} = e^{-\nub} ~\delta^{-1},
\ee
consisting of the gravitational part $e^{\nub}$ and of the second Doppler-like term
\be
\delta = \frac{\sqrt{1-\vz^2}}{1 - \Omega L_Z}.
\ee


For the emission angle we again have to take the rotating frame into account.
This can be done by introducing a projection operator $\bar{h}_{ab} = g_{ab} + s'_a s'_b$, that projects our 4-vectors from the non-rotating frame to the rotating frame where the radiative processes are defined.
As a definition, we can take the emission angle to be the angle between our photon and a spacelike surface normal vector $n_{\alpha} = (0, \cos\gamma/N_n, \rb \sin\gamma/N_n, 0)$ with normalization $N_n = e^{\zetab - \nub}$ fullfilling $n_{\alpha}n^{\alpha} = -1$.
When projected to the rotating-frame we can then obtain the angle from the generalized dot-product definition between two vectors as
\be\label{eq:gen_angle}
\cos\alpha' = \frac{\bar{h}_{ab}n^a u^b}{(\bar{h}_{ab} n^a n^a)^{1/2} (\bar{h}_{ab} u^a u^b)^{1/2}}.
\ee
Using the metric defined by \eqref{eq:BWmetric} and a photon with components as \eqref{eq:p_t}$-$\eqref{eq:p_p}, we obtain
\be
\cos\alpha' = \delta e^{2\nub-\zetab} \left[ p_{\rb} \cos\gamma + \frac{p_{\theta} \sin\gamma}{\rb} \right].
\ee
Here it suffices to notice that we are only interested in the emission angle value at the surface of the star i.e. $\rb = \bar{R}(\theta)$.
The result here is related to the emission angle defined using standard trigonometry \citep[see e.g.][]{PB06} and Lorentz-boosted in to the rotating frame with $\delta$ because of special relativistic abberration.


\subsection{Emission}
Observed flux from a small area on an image plane with photon energy $E$ is
\be
dF_E = I_E d\Omega_o,
\ee
where $I_E$ is the specific intensity of the radiation at infinity and $d\Omega_o$ is the solid angle subtended by the element as measured by the observer.
From here it is easy to see that the total flux is then just an integral of these elements over our whole image plane.
As a final step we then have to connect this observed flux to the actual emerging radiation.

The relation between the emergent energy $E'$ to the observed energy $E$ is $E/E' = (1 + z)^{-1}$.
The connection between the monochromatic observed and local intensity is then (see e.g. \citealt{MTW73}, p.588; \citealt{RL79}, p.145)
\be
I_E = \left( \frac{E}{E'} \right)^3 ~I'_{E'}(\alpha'),
\ee
where $I'_{E'}(\alpha')$ is the intensity computed in the frame comoving with the emitting area.
The radiation here is emitted to the direction of the emission angle $\alpha'$ defined in the local rotating frame.
For the bolometric intensity one gets when integrating over the energies
\be
I = \left(\frac{E}{E'} \right)^4 ~I'(\alpha').
\ee
The total (monochromatic) flux as a function of observer's time $F_E(t)$ can then be obtained by integrating over the whole image
%\begin{align}\begin{split}
\be\label{eq:fluxint}
F_E(t) = \int I_{E}(t) ~d\Omega_o = \int\int \frac{I'_{E'}(t_*, \alpha')}{(1+z)^3}  ~bdb \, d\chi,
\ee
%\end{split}\end{align}
where $t_* = t - \Delta t$ is the time when the photon was originally emitted and can be computed when we know the total travel time $\Delta t$ against some reference photon, for example the one with the shortest path to us.
\red{discussion about rotating the star and invariance of dt*dphi}

All of these quantities on the star's spherical coordinate system $(\theta, \phi)$ are then mapped to the observers polar image coordinates $(b, \chi)$ via raytracing.
This mapping $(b, \chi) \rightarrow (\theta, \phi)$ allows us to then evaluate the physical quantities
\begin{align}
1+z                  &\rightarrow 1+z(\theta, \phi) \rightarrow 1+z(b, \chi), \\
\cos\alpha'          &\rightarrow \cos\alpha'(\theta, \phi) \rightarrow \cos\alpha'(b, \chi), \\
\Delta t             &\rightarrow \Delta t(\theta, \phi) \rightarrow \Delta t(b, \chi), \\
I'_{E'}(t_*, \alpha') &\rightarrow I'_{E'}(t_*, \cos\alpha'; \theta, \phi) \rightarrow I'_{E'}(t_*, \cos\alpha'; b, \chi)
\end{align}
in the observers plane for the flux calculations.

\subsection{Coordinates in the co-rotating frame}
As was discussed earlier, all of the radiative processes are defined in the co-rotating frame of the star's plasma as it is this moving gas that is always the source of the emission.
Because of this, it is natural to define the shape of the emitting regions using the coordinate system of the co-rotating observer.
In practise, this then gives us the integration limits of equation \eqref{eq:fluxint}.

Transformation from the non-rotating frame to the rotating frame can be obtained using a projection operator $\bar{h}_{ab}$ defined previously.
%\be
%\bar{h}_{ab} = g_{ab} + s_a s_b
%\ee
%where $s_a$ is the 4-velocity of the previously defined star's fluid element.
Our metric tensor for the rotating observer is then
\be
\bar{h}_{ab} dx^a dx^b = e^{2(\zetab - \nub)} (d\rb^2 + \rb^2 d\theta) + \frac{\Bb^2 e^{-2\nub} \rb^2 \sin^2\theta}{1-v_Z^2} d\phi_*^2,
\ee
where we have defined a new angular coordinate $\phi_* = \phi - \Omega t$ that is used by the rotating observer.%
\footnote{We thank S. Morsink for pointing this out. 
The normalized longitudinal coordinate ensures that both, rotating and stationary observer, agree that a circle drawn around the star has $2\pi$ radians.}
This new longitudinal coordinate is also seen to be Lorentz contracted by $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = (1-\vz^2)^{-1/2}$ factor.

Next we make a decision to move to a normal (areal) \sch coordinate system so that our patterns on top of the star with different locations have a same covering area.
By using the equations \eqref{eq:rb2r} and \eqref{eq:drb2dr} we obtain a longitudinally Lorentz-boosted metric tensor
\be\label{eq:gammaSch}
h_{ab} dx^a dx^b = e^{-2\nub}dr^2 + \frac{e^{2\zetab}}{\Bb^2} r^2 d\theta + \gamma_{\mathrm{L}}^2 r^2 \sin^2\theta d\phi_*^2,
\ee
that agrees with (areal) \sch coordinate system up to first order in rotation because $e^{\zetab}/\Bb \approx 1 + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2)$.
Additionally we can drop the gravitational redshift term $e^{-2\nub}$ of the radial coordinate as we are only considering unit vectors later on.

In order to define patterns on the surface by using angular distances from some latitude $\theta_{\mathrm{S}}$ we next define a radial vector in (3d) Cartesian coordinate system as
\be
\vec{r} = (x_r, y_r, z_r) = r (\cos\phi_* \sin\theta, \sin\phi_* \sin\theta, \cos\theta).
\ee
%where normalization factor $\hat{R} = \sqrt{x_r^2 + y_r^2 + z_r^2}$.
By using a Jacobian $\partial(x_r, y_r, z_r)/\partial (r, \theta, \phi_*)$ we can transform the metric \eqref{eq:gammaSch} into a Cartesian coordinate basis and by setting $\phi_*=0$ we define our frame with $y$-axis along the direction of the motion, $x$-axis along the meridian towards the equator, and $z$ axis along the radial direction.
Hence, the co-rotating observer has a Cartesian metric
\begin{align}\begin{split}
%&\hat{g}_{ij} dx^i dx^j &= \frac{\partial(r, \theta, \phi_*)}{\partial{(x, y, z)} h_{ab} dx^a dx^b  \\
& \hat{g}_{ij} d\hat{x}^i d\hat{x}^j = \frac{\partial x^a \partial x^b}{\partial \hat{x}^i \partial \hat{x}^j} h_{ab} dx^a dx^b  \\
&= \gamma_L^2 dy^2 + \frac{1}{2} ( (1+\mathcal{B}^2)(dx^2 + dz^2) \\
&+ (\mathcal{B}^2 - 1)(dx-dz)(dx + dz) \cos(2\theta) - 2dx dz \sin(2\theta) ) \\
& = dx^2 + \gamma_L^2 dy^2 + dz^2 + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2)
\end{split}\end{align}
From here it is then easy to obtain the great circle distance (on a unit sphere) as measured by the co-rotating observer by using the generalized inner-product \eqref{eq:gen_angle} to get an angle
\be\label{eq:rel_cos}
\cos\rho = \frac{\cos\theta \cos\theta_\mathrm{S} + \cos\phi \sin\theta \sin\theta_{\mathrm{S}}}{\sqrt{ \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta (\cos\phi^2 + \gamma_{\mathrm{L}}^2 \sin\phi^2)}} + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2), 
\ee
between locations at $(\theta, \phi)$ and $(\theta_{\mathrm{S}}, 0)$.
This angle definition of $\rho$ is then a distance as measured on top of a co-rotating unit sphere.
It is also possible to generalize the aforementioned angle for oblate surfaces by considering a projection operator $\hat{h}_{ab} = g_{ab} + s'_a s'_b - n_a n_b$ with an additional term $n_a$ that is the previously defined normal to the surface.
%Physically, however, most of the shapes considered here are produced by the (co-rotating) magnetic field that is usually modelled in spherical coordinate system.
%For an oblate surface we can then just project this shape to the surface that is not perpendicular to the magnetic field.

We also note that the area element of the co-rotating observer can be obtained from
\begin{align}\begin{split}
dS' &= \sqrt{\det h_{ab}} d\theta d\phi_* \\
&= \frac{e^{\zetab}}{B} \gamma_{\mathrm{L}} r^2 \sin\theta d\theta d\phi_* = \gamma_{\mathrm{L}} dS + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2). \\
\end{split}\end{align}
Hence, if we define our coordinates in the static frame and then integrate over some shape on top of the surface using these coordinates, our flux would differ by a $\gamma_{\mathrm{L}}$ factor.

%In order to compare our calculations to previous \sch 
%In addition, one needs to take into account the transformation of the solid angle $\Omega_0 = dS'\cos/\sigma$ with area element $dS$ and the corresponding observer angle $\cos\sigma$, that are defined in the non-rotating frame.
%Transformation of this element from the non-rotating to rotating frame can be obtained using a projection operator of a co-rotating observer\footnote{We thank S. Morsink for pointing this out}
%\be
%h_{ab} = g_{ab} + s_a s_b - n_a n_b,
%\ee
%where $s_a$ is the 4-velocity of the previously defined star's fluid element and $w_a$ is again the 4-velocity orthogonal to the oblate surface. 
%Using this operator perpendicular to the star's surface, we can then define the area element as $dS' = \sqrt{\det{h_{ab}}} dx^1 dx^2$ with surface coordinates $x^1$ and $x^2$.
%The two-dimensional metric tensor for the surface is then
%\be
%h_{ab} dx^a dx^b = e^{2(\zetab - \nub)} \rb^2 d\rb^2 + \frac{B^2 e^{-2\nub} \rb^2 \sin^2\theta}{1-v_Z^2} (d\phi - \Omega dt)^2
%\ee
%and hence we get
%\begin{align}\begin{split}
%dS' =& \frac{e^{\zetab}}{B} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_Z^2}} e^{2\nub} \Bb^2 \rb^2 \sin\theta d\theta (d\phi - \Omega dt) \\
%  =& \frac{e^{\zetab}}{B} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_Z^2}} dS_o.
%\end{split}\end{align}
%In the limit of \sch space-time $e^{\zetab}/B \approx 1 + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2)$ and so we obtain a standard result where the latitudinal direction is just Lorentz contracted with $\gamma = (1-v^2)^{-1/2}$ as $v_Z = v + \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$.

\subsection{Angular distribution of radiation}
\subsubsection{Isotropic radiation}

In practise for the pulse profile calculations the simplest angular distribution of radiation is given by the Lambert law.
Here we consider blackbody emission described by the specific intensity
\begin{equation}
  B_{\mathrm{E}}(T) = 5.04 \times 10^{22} \frac{E^3}{\mathrm{exp}(E/T) -1}~\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{keV}^{-1}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $T$ and $E$ are given in keV.
Here the radiation is isotropic and hence there is no angle $\mu = \cos\alpha'$ dependency in our intensity function where $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle relative to the surface normal as measured by the co-rotating observer.

\subsubsection{Electron scattering dominated atmosphere}

As a second case we consider the so-called ``Hopf profile'' that is no longer isotropic.
We assume that the spectral distribution is still given by the Planck function, but the angular distribution is produced in coherent electron scattering dominated plane-parallel semi-infinite ($\tau \rightarrow \infty$) atmosphere as
\begin{equation}
  I_{\mathrm{E}}(\mu) = B_{\mathrm{E}}(T) \frac{H(\mu)}{2\alpha_1},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  a_n = \int_0^1 H(\mu) \mu^n d\mu
\end{equation}
are the moments of the function $H(\mu)$, which is a solution of the Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhar integral equation \citep[see e.g.][]{Cha60,Sob63}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hmu}
  H(\mu) = 1 + \mu H(\mu) \int_0^1 \frac{\Psi(\eta)}{\mu + \eta} H(\eta) d\eta.
\end{equation}
Here $\Psi(\mu)$ is the characteristic function, which depends on the scattering law considered.
For Rayleigh (Thomson) scattering it is given as
\begin{equation}
  \Psi(\mu) = \frac{3}{16}(3-\mu^2).
\end{equation}
Integral equation \eqref{eq:hmu} can then be iteratively solved, for example, by computing
\begin{align}\begin{split}
&H_{n+1}(\mu) =  \frac{1}{2} H_n(\mu) + \\ &\frac{1}{2}\left( \left[1-2\int_0^1 \Psi(\eta)d\eta \right]^{1/2} + \int_0^1 \frac{\eta \Psi(\eta)}{\mu + \eta} H_n(\eta) d\eta \right)^{-1},
\end{split}\end{align}
with a starting guess of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:apprx_hopf}
  H_0(\mu) = 1 + 2.3\mu - 0.3\mu^2.
\end{equation}
We also note that even the simple polynomial expansion \eqref{eq:apprx_hopf} has an accuracy better than $<2\%$ already and can be used in some approximative solutions with corresponding first moment of $\alpha_1 = 1.19167$.


\subsection{Method of solution}

}
\end{figure}


In practise we trace the photons from the image plate at infinity all the way to the surface of the star by solving the first order differential equations \eqref{eq:deltatime} - \eqref{eq:deltaphi} backwards in time.
In addition, we make a change of variable $r \rightarrow 1/\tilde{x}$ that will help us by stretching the step when far from the star and shortening it when coming close to the star surface.
Here a 2nd order Heun's Runge-Kutta integrator is used with adaptive stepsize with forward Euler's method as predictor and trapezoidal method as corrector.
All photons that travel more than $0.95\tilde{x}$ away from the star after a U-turn are terminated and considered to be missed.

Our image plate is defined by using a polar coordinate system with radial parameter $b$ (i.e. the impact parameter) and angle parameter $\chi$.
We also employ a non-equidistant grid in both parameters to accommodate the extra resolution needed around the edges of the star.
Radial parameter $b$ is defined using a Gauss-Laguerre abscissae (i.e. $e^{-b}$ weighted) and the angle coordinate is weighted with a simple sinusoidal function so that the resolution is increased around the top and bottom parts where $\chi = 0$ or $\pi$ that is near where the poles are located (see Fig.~\ref{fig:grid}).
By raytracing we then obtain some mapping between the star's and image planes coordinates in some fixed positions.
Arbitrary positions in the image plane are then obtained by a linear interpolation in $(b, \chi)$ space.

For pulse profile calculations where only a small part of the star is emitting we first search a crude location of the spot on the image plane and then impose a fine subgrid around it in order to accurately calculate the flux from this small patch.
The subgrid itself is defined either in polar grid (by constraining minimum and maximum $\chi$ and $b$) or in Cartesian image grid (by constraining minimum and maximum $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$) depenging on the total area covered.
To calculate the total flux $F(t)$ we then integrate this small subgrid by using an adaptive multidimensional integration.
The algorithm is based on a tensor product of nested Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules and is implemented using the \textsc{Cubature} package.

\section{Comparison \& accuracy}

\subsection{Schwarzchild $+$ Doppler}

To validate the accuracy of the code we did several comparisons against previously made pulse profile calculations.
First a general comparison of the ray tracing algorithms was made against the so-called Schwarzchild $+$ Doppler approximation \citep[see e.g.][]{PB06}.
In addition, only spherical star was considered here.
The comparison code here propagate photons forward in time (from the surface to the observed) so it is a great validation tool for many of the underlying methods because in our case the photons are propagated backwards in time.

Main parameters are: stellar mass $M = 1.6~\Msun$, stellar radius $R = 12~\mathrm{km}$, the observer inclination $i = 60^{\circ}$, colatitude of the spot $\theta_{\mathrm{d}} = 50^{\circ}$.
The effective temperature of the radiation is taken to be $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2~\mathrm{keV}$. 
The distance to the source is assumed to be $D = 10~\mathrm{kpc}$.
The spot is circular with angular radius $\rho$ either $1$ or $30$ degree.
Here we stress that the spot is defined using an angle as measured by the co-rotating observer (see eq. \eqref{eq:rel_cos}) for a unit sphere.
Hence, the spot is circular in shape for the co-rotating observer, not for the static observer.
Angular distribution of radiation either corresponds to Lambert law (isotropic blackbody) with constant intensity or electron scattering dominated atmosphere, i.e. Hopf profile.

The light curves are computed on 128 time bins.
Zero time $t = 0$ corresponds to the moment, when the spot center crosses the plane defined by the spin axis and the direction to the observer.
Following 5 light curves are computed: monochromatic photon flux ($\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{keV}^{-1}$) at the observer energies $E = 2,~6$ and $12~\mathrm{keV}$, bolometric photon flux ($\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), and the bolometric energy flux ($\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

  Light curve comparisons for Schwarzchild spacetime with rapidly rotating spherical star ($\nu = 400~\mathrm{Hz}$).

}
\end{figure*}


Comparison of these lightcurves are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sch_comp1} for slowly rotating star ($1$ Hz) and in Fig.~\ref{fig:sch_comp400} for fast rotation ($400$ Hz).
In practise, comparing the profiles for slow rotation only tests our ray tracing routines because special relativistic effects (Doppler boosting, angle aberration and so on) are negliglible.
Overall agreement of the two different methods is excellent and from here a baseline accuracy of about $<0.2\%$ relative error is constrained for the mapping of quantities between image plane and star's surface.
Similarly, when rotation is increased and special relativistic effects start to play a role we are able to reproduce the pulse profiles usually down to $<0.3\%$ relative error.
No large deviation between isotropic and Hopf profile is detected either, indicating that the emission angle is also computed correctly.

\subsection{Oblate Schwarzchild $+$ Doppler}

Next we compare emission from oblate surfaces.
The surface here is defined using the radius function \eqref{eq:radf} but the star is still embbed in a symmetric \sch spacetime.
The parameters used are equatorial radius $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 12~\mathrm{km}$ (in the usual \sch metric), star mass of $M = 1.4~\Msun$, extreme rotational frequency $\nu = 700~\mathrm{Hz}$, observer inclination $i=45^{\circ}$, and spot angular size of $\rho = 10^{\circ}$
Effective temperature of the radiation is again taken to be $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2~\mathrm{keV}$ and the distance $D = 10~\mathrm{kpc}$.
Here the spot size is again defined in the co-rotating \textit{spherical} coordinate system on top of a unit sphere and is then projected to the oblate inclined surface.
To trace the effects of the changing surface we consider the spot in three different locations at colatitudes of $\theta_{\mathrm{S}} = 18^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$, and $90^{\circ}$.
Additionally for $\theta_{\mathrm{S}} = 90^{\circ}$ when the spot is on the equator we observer a full eclipse in the light curve.
This imposes a serious test for both of the codes as the gradually more and more blocked spot is also seen from a very shallow angle before disappearing and appearing again.
We note that when integrating flux from the spot in the image plane, a polar subgrid is extremely useful just before the eclipse as the impact parameter can vary only by a $\sim1\%$ before the spot is hidden behind the star.
Attaining a similar resolution in a Cartesian subgrid would then need far more integrand evaluations as the spot is seen from a very shallow angle.

\section{Additional stuff about elliptic integrals and so on}

After separating the equations with the help of the Carter constant $\Ca$ we get the remaining four-momentum components to be
\be\label{eq:pr}
p_r = \pd_r S = e^{-2\nub} \left( (E-L_z \omega)^2 - \frac{\mathcal{C}}{e^{-2\nub} r^2} \right)^{1/2} = \mathcal{R}(r)
\ee
and
\be\label{eq:ptheta}
p_{\theta} = \pd_{\theta} S = e^{\mu} \left( \mathcal{C} - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 \theta} \right)^{1/2} = \Theta(\theta).
\ee
Also, now in addition to our pre-defined constants $E$ and $L_z$ we get a new constant of motion thanks to $\mathcal{C}$ that leads to
\be
\frac{\pd S}{\pd \mathcal{C}} = \frac{1}{2} \int^r \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathcal{R}}} \frac{\pd \mathcal{R}}{\pd \mathcal{C}} dr + \frac{1}{2} \int^{\theta} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Theta}} \frac{\pd \Theta}{\pd \mathcal{C}} d\theta = 0.
\ee 
After substitution and cancellation of terms the relation leads to elliptic integrals of the form
\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:Lz_C_rel}
 \int^r dr e^{\nub} & r^{-2} \left( (E-L_z\omega)^2 - \frac{\mathcal{C}}{e^{-2\nub} r^2} \right)^{-3/4}  = \\
& \int^{\theta} d\theta e^{\mu/2} \left(\mathcal{C} - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 \theta} \right)^{-3/4}
\end{split}\end{align}
connecting our three constants of motion.
The underlying elliptic integral nature becomes more prominent when we remember that $e^{\mu} \approx 1$ (i.e. constant without $\theta$ depdendeny) yielding a more refined equation for the latter integral in \eqref{eq:Lz_C_rel} of
\be
-\frac{e^{\mu/2} L_z}{\mathcal{C} (\mathcal{C}-L_z^2)^{1/4}} [ \Pi(n; \alpha, -1)+\Pi(-n;\alpha, -1)],
\ee
where $\Pi$ is the incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind with parameters $n = \sqrt{1-L_z^2/\mathcal{C}}$ as the elliptic charasteristic and the angle $\alpha$ defined as $\sin^4 \alpha = (\mathcal{C}-L_z^2 \csc^2 \theta)/(\mathcal{C}-L_z^2))$ with elliptic modulus of $-1$.


\section{Special case: equatorial rays}
If we limit ourselves to the equatorial plane ($\theta=\pi/2$ reflection symmetry) the bending equations are simplified tremendously due to the loss of four-momentum component along the $\hat{\theta}$ direction.
The general coordinates of a photon are defined as $x^{\alpha} = (x^{t}, x^{r}, x^{\theta}, x^{\phi})$ and the four-velocity is obtained from $dx^{\alpha}/d\lambda$ through affine parameter $\lambda$.
Again, due to the two Killing vectors $k^{\alpha}$ and $m^{\alpha}$ we now set our constants directly to $u_{t} = 1$ and $u_{\phi} = b$, where $b$ is an impact parameter defined more thouroughly later on.
In the equatorial plane a dual of the four-velocity is then $u_{\alpha} = (1, u_{r}, 0, b)$.
Finally, from $x^{\alpha}x_{\alpha} = 0$ we can solve the $u_{r}$ component to be
\be
u_{r} = e^{-2\nub}\sqrt{(1-b\omega)^2 - e^{2\nub}\frac{b^2}{r^2}} 
\ee

The emission angle $\alpha$ is easily obtained by using the vector notation
\be
\tan \alpha = \frac{(u^{\phi}u_{\phi})^{1/2}}{(u^ru_r)^{1/2}}
\ee
yielding
\begin{align}\begin{split}
\cos \alpha = & 1 + (e^{-2\nub}r^2\omega^2 -1) \times \\
            & \left( 1+b\omega - \sqrt{(1+b\omega)^2 - \left(\frac{b}{e^{-\nub}r}\right)^2} \right),
\end{split}\end{align}
that reduced to 
\be
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{b}{e^{-\nub_0}r} \right)^2},
\ee
on the limit of no rotation $\omega \rightarrow 0$ that corresponds to the solution in \sch space-time when we remeber that $e^{\nub_0} = (1-\rg/R)$.
