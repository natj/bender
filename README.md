# Bender
### Radiation from rapidly rotating oblate neutron stars
----------

Bender is a ray tracing code for computing radiation from rotating neutron stars. 
Or to put it in another way: Bender is a collection of scripts written in high-level programming language for easy adaptation and modification.
We take into account all of the important special and general relativistic effects that change the emerging radiation. 
Hence, it can be used to compute the observed energy spectra of emerging radiation when the initial flux energy distribution is known. 
Additionally, we can deal with different beaming patterns, i.e., angle dependency of the radiation from the NS surface. 
There is also a possibility to compute time-dependent spectra for e.g., pulse profile computations. 
For a more in-depth discussion about the physics, see the main paper Nättilä & Pihajoki (2016).
